		<h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
		<div class="text">
			<p>I am a freshman at Tufts University intending to major in
			Computer Science and French. I'm passionate about education and
			design, and within Computer Science, I'm interested in EdTech,
			front-end development, UX/UI, and Computer Science Education.</p>
			<p>My CS journey began with an ill-fated One Direction fan blog that I
			ran on Tumblr in middle school. I started teaching myself basic HTML and
			CSS to change the layout of the blog, eventually becoming comfortable
			enough with the syntax to design my own themes. Today, my love of boy
			bands has (thankfully) faded, but the coding skills I learned through
			making themes have not, and I now use them to design and sell commissioned
			themes to individual bloggers. The love of coding and appreciation
			for design that I discovered on Tumblr eventually inspired me to enroll
			in the Computer Science program at Tufts.</p>
			<p>On campus, I'm a Health Educator with the Peer Health Exchange, and
			have recently joined the CodeSquad JumboCode team to work on Frontend
			Development and UX/UI. This semester, I will also be volunteering with
			Tufts Girls of Code and leading the team to build their website.</p>
			<p>Outside of school, I love skiing, baking brownies, hiking, and
			doing arts and crafts projects. I enjoy working with younger students,
			and in addition to my current work in Health education, I have experience
			working with students from all backgrounds as a tutor, mentor, and
			camp counselor.</p>
