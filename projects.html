			<h2>Experiences (Software Engineering)</h2>
                        <span class="proj-name">Software Engineering Intern on Business Risk @Braintree </span>
                        <p>I worked on a team of engineers buildling an internal tool for risk detection. I worked on various projects to improve the application, and had opportunities to explore interesting challenges across the tech stack. I added new jobs and job factories to the Rails backend, worked on UI improvements in JavaScript, wrote SQL queries to pull data from new regions into the application's data pipeline, and worked on an infrastructure project to port the application to Kubernetes.</p>

                        <span class="proj-name">Project Manager for Tufts JumboCode (Fall 2018)</span>
                        <p>This fall, I'll be managing a team of engineers to design and implement a software project (TBD) for a local nonprofit organization. More information to come!</p>
			<span class="proj-name">Software Development and UI Design for Tufts JumboCode (Spring 2017)</span>
			<p>I worked on a team of Tufts CS students to design, build, and test an internal dashboard system for a local nonprofit coding bootcamp. I focused mainly on client-side development, implementing templates for the Django back-end. I also had the opportunity to work under the team's lead UI designer to design the interfaces.</p>
			<span class="proj-name">Website Development Team Lead, Tufts Girls of Code</span>
			<p>I led a team of three students to design and develop the website for Tufts Girls of Code. The website advertises our monthly coding workshops, which reach 30 girls each month and introduce topics from game design to web development. Starting in Fall 2018, I will be running the GOC program along with another undergraduate student.</p>

			<h2>Academic Projects</h2>
                        <span class="proj-name">RPC | COMP117 Distributed Systems</span>
                        <p>A Python program to generate stubs and proxies in C++ from a C++ header file for remote procedure calls.</p>
                        <span class="proj-name">File Copy | COMP117 Distributed Systems</span>
                        <p>A C++ program to copy a directory of files across an imperfect network. After reading the famous <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf">End-to-end Arguments in System Design</a> paper, we began by build an end-to-end verification system to check whether files had been correctly copied. We then implemented the logic to copy the files in packets and attempt to recover from dropped or reordered packets.
			<span class="proj-name">Arith | COMP40</span>
			An image compressor and decompressor program written in C which operates on .ppm image files, compressing RGB pixel data into 32-bit words, and unpacking 32-bit words into RGB pixel data. Through this project, I studied bit-level representations and manipulations of data and floating-point arithmetic. Our final result compressor and decompressor both "produce less error than the reference implementation".
			<span class="proj-name">Universal Machine | COMP40</span>
			An emulator for a Turing-complete universal machine (UM) with 13 commands written in C.	This was a multi-part project: we spent the first week designing and building the UM, primarily focused on how best to emulate its segmented memory in software. We then spent the next week using profiling tools to optimize our UM to be more than 10x faster. Finally, we wrote a simple RPN calculator in UM assembly to run on the UM.

     		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
     		<span class="proj-name">Ciralism Themes</span>
     		My tech story began like this: when I was in the 8th grade, I <i>really</i> loved One Direction. I ran a fan blog, and like most dedicated fan bloggers, I needed a perfect layout to display my posts. I couldn't find exactly what I wanted readily available, so I decided to make it, and taught myself HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. Over the next few years, I began designing, developing, and releasing themes for public use. I amassed a following of users in the thousands, and generated >$1k in revenue selling commissioned custom themes to individual bloggers. <p>Working on this project gave me a venue to learn about web development and design and to really dig into UX/UI. I still occasionally post new themes. It also taught me the valuable skill of self-studying and learning on the job. My work is available to view <a href="http://ciralism.tumblr.com/tagged/themes">here</a> (recent work is shown first). A curated selection of my best web design/development work is available <a href="http://ciralismportfolio.tumblr.com">here</a>. </p>
