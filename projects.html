		<h1>Projects & Experiences</h1>
		<div class="short_bio">
			<h2>Experiences (Programming)</h2>
			<span class="proj-name">Front-end Development and UI Design for Tufts JumboCode (Spring 2017)</span>
			<p>I worked on a team of Tufts CS students to design, build, and test an internal dashboard system for a local nonprofit coding bootcamp. I focused mainly on client-side development, implementing templates for the Django back-end. I also had the opportunity to work under the team's lead UI designer to design the interfaces.</p>
			<span class="proj-name">Website Development Team Lead, Tufts Girls of Code</span>
			<p>I led a team of three students to design and develop the website for Tufts Girls of Code. The website advertises our monthly coding workshops, which reach 30 girls each month and introduce topics from game design to web development. This year, all of our workshops have been sold out since August!</p>

			<h2>Academic Projects</h2>
			<span class="proj-name">Arith | COMP40</span>
			An image compressor and decompressor program written in C which operates on .ppm image files, compressing RGB pixel data into 32-bit words, and unpacking 32-bit words into RGB pixel data. Through this project, I studied bit-level representations and manipulations of data and floating-point arithmetic. Our final result compressor and decompressor both "produce less error than the reference implementation".
			<span class="proj-name">Universal Machine | COMP40</span>
			(Current project) An emulator written in C for a Turing-complete Universal Machine.

     		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
     		<span class="proj-name">Ciralism Themes</span>
     		My tech story began like this: when I was in the 8th grade, I <i>really</i> loved One Direction. I ran a fan blog, and like most dedicated fan bloggers, I needed a perfect layout to display my posts. I couldn't find exactly what I wanted readily available, so I decided to make it, and taught myself HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. Over the next few years, I began designing, developing, and releasing themes for public use. I amassed a following of users in the thousands, and generated >$1k in revenue selling commissioned custom themes to individual bloggers. <p>Working on this project gave me a venue to learn about web development and design and to really dig into UX/UI. I still occasionally post new themes. It also taught me the valuable skill of self-studying and learning on the job. My work is available to view <a href="http://ciralism.tumblr.com/tagged/themes">here</a> (recent work is shown first). A curated selection of my best web design/development work is available <a href="http://ciralismportfolio.tumblr.com">here</a>. </p>

     		<h2>Experiences (Teaching)</h2>
     		<span class="proj-name">Teaching Assistant, Tufts Computer Science Department</span>
     		Fall 2017: TA for Intro to Computer Science (COMP11). As a TA, I assist in weekly breakout lab sections, including leading mini lectures on topics from class, and guiding students through short programming assignments. I also hold open office hours to help students through challenging homework assignments, and grade homework and lab work.
     		<p>In Spring 2018, I will be working as a TA for Data Structures and Algorithms (COMP15).</p>
     		<span class="proj-name">Teaching Assistant, Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program</span>
     		As a TA for GWC SIP, I provided an introductory CS curriculum to a class of 17 girls in Washington, D.C.. In addition to helping students through projects and coaching students on college and career readiness, I also had the opportunity to take ownership of the web development portion of the curriculum, and gave lectures on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Django, and web security. I also oversaw the design and implementation of six successful final projects, from an informational website about local homeless shelters to a "Solar Stalker" light tracking robot.
     		<span class="proj-name">Workshop Leader, Tufts Girls of Code</span>
     		I support students participating in coding workshops on a variety of topics. On November 11th, I led a sold-out RenPy workshop where 30 girls built their own Hermione Granger-themed "Choose Your Own Adventure" games.
