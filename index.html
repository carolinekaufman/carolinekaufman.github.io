		<h4>Hi there, I'm</h4>
		<h1>Caroline Kaufman</h1>
		<div class="short_bio">
			<p>I'm a software engineer at Datadog, where I work on the Revenue Engineering team.
			I recently graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a second major in French.
			I'm really passionate about privacy, ethics in computing, and Computer Science education. I worked as a Teaching Fellow throughout
			my undergrad career, and I especially loved working with new coders in our Intro to CS and Data Structures courses.
			I really enjoy teaching and mentoring, and whether we've met or not,
		  if I can ever be helpful to you, I would love to chat! You can email me at carolinekaufman97 [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>
			<p>In my free time, I love to read, travel, paint, practice my French by watching standup specials and listening to podcasts, and hang out with my dogs,
			Ruby and Norm. I volunteer as a college coach with <a href="https://scholarmatch.org/">ScholarMatch</a> and as a WAVE Advisor for <a href="https://www.builtbygirls.com/">BUILT BY GIRLS</a>,
		  and I serve on the External Advisory Board of the Tufts Department of Computer Science. My job will eventually bring me to New York, but
		  for the time being, you'll find me working remotely around New England and enjoying any opportunity to get outside, whether it's an early morning lake swim
		  or a sunset hike after work.</p>
